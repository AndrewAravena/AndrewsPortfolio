        <p>This year in my technology class i was told to make a light for a stake holder, this light could be anything as long as i make it, with that information
            i decided to make a chandelier, why a chandelier well because my mom. Ever since i was a little kid my mom said one day there will be a chandelier being hung up there
            one day we will buy one and hang it up, and so more years passed and more and there never was, and my mom decided to DIY one which looked alright, not the best but 
            for what we had it was amazing. but she never really felt completed with that, but with age so comes less abilities and more issues on making things. So when i was told i need to make a light 
            the idea sparked instantaniously, my mom. shes the perfect stakeholder, a chandeleir will be what i make. what material, well iron is expensive and heavy ( i would love to work with it but not enough funds)
            so next best option alluminium, i can melt it with its low melting point and cast it in sand then remove it, what a great idea, i never realised working with molten metal would be 
            scholarship levels of difficulty my teacher at the start never thought i had the abilites to actually make a chandeleir its too difficult, i asked him to give me a percentage that he thinks i would complete the chandeleir and he said 5%
            this was the same percentage as last year when i decided to make a monitor stand with a volume mixer arduino that controls different applications, and so the journy begun impress my teacher and make my mother proud. 
            the more and more the year progressed the more my teacher actually believed in me, seeing me research and make a furnace to melt the aluminium, learn to weld, make more precise 3d models of my design to be able to print it and cast it
            he seemed excited. the chandeleir that seemed impossible for a year 12 student, a scholarship/ univeristy level project seems so close to being able to be made. with all the advanced techniques, welding, casting, 3d printing, difusing light, micro controller. 
            but thats all i can say for now, as im half way done and still need to find a 3d printer big enough to print my mold.

        <p>
            during the making of the 3d model of the chandelier i went through multiple issues, how id get the light to
            work in reality how could i make it new and different. how i could make it look good, the models turned out
            sub par, i think i could of done better but for the moment those models have every detail that the end
            result will have, now i need to figure out a controller to use and how i can achive voice activation for the
            light
