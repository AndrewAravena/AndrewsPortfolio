        <p>This year in my technology class, I was told to make a light for a
            stakeholder.

            This
            light could be anything as long as I
            made
            it.
            With
            that information, I decided to make a chandelier.
            Why
            a chandelier?
            Well,
            because of my mom. Ever since I was a little kid, my mom said one day there
            would
            be a chandelier hung up there
            .
            One day, we
            would
            buy one and hang it up.
            As
            more years passed, there never was
            one
            , and my mom decided to DIY one, which looked alright-not the best, but for what we had, it was amazing.
            However,
            she never really felt
            complete
            with that,
            and
            with age comes
            fewer
            abilities and more issues with making things. So when I was told I
            needed
            to make a light, the idea sparked
            instantaneously-
            my mom.
            She's
            the perfect stakeholder. A
            chandelier
            will be what I make.
            What
            material? Well, iron is expensive and heavy (
            I
            would love to work with it, but not enough funds), so the next best option
            is
            aluminum. I can melt it with its low melting point, cast it in sand
            ,
            and then remove it
            .
            What a great idea! I never
            realized
            working with molten metal would be scholarship-level difficulty
            .
            My teacher at the start never thought I had the
            abilities
            to actually make a
            chandelier.
            It's too difficult, he said. I asked him to give me a percentage
            of
            how likely he
            thought
            I would complete the
            chandelier,
            and he said 5%
            .
            This was the same percentage as last year when I decided to make a monitor stand with a volume mixer
            Arduino
            that controls different applications.
            And
            so the
            journey

            began-to
            impress my teacher and make my mother proud.
            The
            more the year progressed
            ,
            the more my teacher actually believed in me.
            Seeing
            me research and make a furnace to melt the aluminum, learn to weld,
            and
            create more precise 3D models of my design to be able to print and cast
            them

            made
            him seem excited.
            The

            chandelier
            that seemed impossible for a
            Year
            12 student, a scholarship/
            university-
            level project,
            seemed
            so close to being able to be made.
            With
            all the advanced techniques-welding, casting, 3D printing,
            diffusing
            light,
            microcontrollers-
            but
            that's
            all I can say for now, as I'm
            halfway
            done and still need to find a 3D printer big enough to print my mold.

            During
            the
            creation
            of the 3D model of the chandelier, I
            encountered
            multiple issues: how I would get the light to work in reality, how I could make it new and different, and
            how I could make it look good.
            The
            models turned out
            subpar;
            I think I could have done better, but for the moment, those models
            include
            every detail that the end result will have. Now,
            I
            need to figure out a controller to use and how I can
            achieve
            voice activation for the light.
