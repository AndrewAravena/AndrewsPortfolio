            <p>
                in 2025 i begun creating games i also begun learning blender for 3d modeling. My decision of learning
                blender is to hone my abilites and be able to work with 3d models to be able to create a professional
                looking 3d game next year with the concepts that i currently have for a game. my inspiration for my next
                year game will be a Devil May Cry and soulsborne idea, with high difficulty bosses but enjoyable story
                telling. <br> <br>
                currently have made more blender 3d models.

                    world, the whole city and town are trying to stop you, is anyone in this world sane and know your
