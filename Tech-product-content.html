            <p>In the year 2024,
                during
                Year 11
                in

                Technology

                Product

                Design
                , I embarked on my first actual year of self-learning (kind of). My teacher tells the class,
                "Your
                project should be flat-packable and fit within the dimensions of an A3 box
                ."

                With
                that, ideas
                begin

                to
                flow; everyone
                is
                brainstorming what to
                create.

                Then
                he says
                we
                need a stakeholder;
                we
                must
                design
                this for someone. Ideas grow scarce.
                Who
                can I make this for? My mom? My dad? My brother?
                And
                what could I
                create

                for
                them? Then an idea
                pops
                into my head: a monitor stand.
                But
                that's too basic; I need to make it better and more advanced. A monitor stand with an Arduino-powered
                volume mixer-that's
                a
                perfect idea! I need to learn to solder, program, and wire an Arduino Nano.


                But
                how will I construct the joints? I don't want to do
                woodwork;
                that feels too permanent. I need to make it future-proof. 3D printed joints-now that's an amazing idea!
                I'll
                create 3D printed joints that hold the wood together firmly
                ,
                along with a 3D printed Arduino case to
                house
                the wires, switches, and analog dials.
                I'm

                using

                advanced techniques: 3D printing
                ,
                microcontrollers,
                and programming.
                This
                project turned out to be similar to my
                Year
                13 friend's; they were making a controller too at the time
                .
                But never mind that; I need to figure out how
                I'll
                do the joints.
                What
                will
                be
                the actual dimensions of the project
                ?

                How
                big
                should
                it be? How much force does it need to withstand?
                How
                much load can the joints
                handle?
                I decided on a thickness of 12mm; that seems sturdy
                but
                not
                overly
                thick. It'll work.
                But
                what type of wood should I use? I need it to be strong, so I
                opted
                for
                plywood-
                high strength and easy to work with.


                Now,
                how high and long should I make the project?
                Will
                I need to measure the length of a monitor stand
                ? Okay
                , 30cm (300mm) seems standard, so
                I'll
                make the length 40cm (400mm)
                .

                How
                high?
                I'll
                choose 15cm.
                I'll
                get those pieces cut and ready, and now it's time to model the joints and test
                their
                strength.
                These
                joints were able to hold up to
                20kg
                per joint without cracking, only
                beginning to crack
                at
                around

                30kg
                .
                They
                were strong and
                sturdy-perfect!
                With that, I made the first
                joint
                to
                hold
                the wood upright.
                Now
                I need to
                create
                additional joints: one to hold a piece of wood in the middle and
                another
                to
                support
                a smaller piece. So, I
                began
                testing and
                creating;
                they were easy to model,
                but
                the real
                challenge
                was making the mechanical switches fit into my Arduino controller
                case
                .
                Those
                took a whole lot of
                testing!

                While making my
                final

                project
                for my Technology Product Design class in 2024, I also worked on fusion models to show how the design
                would look once completed. I used these models to 3D print the
                Arduino
                controller that I had made. To get exact
                measurements
                and make it as best as possible, I had to go into high detail when doing the mechanical keyboard
                switches for my controller to
                ensure
                that they
                didn't
                fall out easily and that they could fit in without issues.
                This
                took
                trial
                and error, but in the end, it had an overwhelmingly good outcome.
                The
                space inside was compact and small to where the wires were all bundled up; this was a design flaw, but I
                couldn't
                figure out another way to keep it small and compact with good wire management.
