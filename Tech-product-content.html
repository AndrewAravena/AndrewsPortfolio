            <p> the year 2024, year 11 mags, technology product design, first actual year of self learning( kind of ), My teahcer tells the class, your project should be flat packable, and fit in the dimensions of a a3 box,
                and with that ideas flow in, everyone thinking of what to do, then he says you need a stakeholder, you need to make this for someone.ideas grow scarse, for who can i make this for, my mom? my dad? my brother, and what could i make,
                then the idea shows in my head, a monitor stand, but thats to basic i need to make it better more advanced. A monitor stand with a arduino powered volume mixer. Perfect idea, learn to solder, programme and wire an arduino nano.
                but how will i do the joints, i dont want to do wood work, thats too perminant, i need to make it future proof, 3d printed joints, thats an amazing idea, make 3d printed joints that hold the wood together firmly 
                and a 3d printed ardunio case to hold the wires, switches and analog dials. Advnaced technique 3d Printing, microcontroler and programming. this project turned out similar to my year 13 friend they were making a controller too at the time, 
                but never mind that, i need to figure out how ill do the joints, what dimensions will the actual project be, how big, how much force does it need to withstand, how much load can the joints take. thickness 12mm that seems sturdy and not too thick, itll work, but what wood
                i need it to be strong so i decided on ply wood, high strength easy to work with. but now how high and long do i make the project, will i need to measure out the length of a monitor stand, okay 30cm (300mm) so ill make the length 40cm (400mm)
                and how high, ill choose 15cm high, get those peices cut and ready, now to model the joints, and test the strength. these joints were able to hold up to 20kgs per joint without cracking, and only cracking at about 30kgs. they were strong 
                sturdy, perfect, and with that i made the first join to make the wood be able to stand, now i need to make other joints, one to hold a piece of wood in the middle an one to have a smaller piece.
                and so i begun testing and making, they were easy to model and make the real issue was making the mechanical switches fit into my case for my arduino controller. those took a whole lot of tests.

                While making my Final Project for my Technology Product Design class in 2024 i also worked on fusion
                models to show
                how the design would look once completed, I also used these models to 3d print the arduino controller
                that i had made
                to be able to get exact messurements and make it as best as possible, i had to go into high detail when
                doing the mechanical keyboard
                switches for my controller to make sure that they didnt fall out easily, and that they could fit in
                without issues, this took trail and error but in the
                end had a overwhelmingly good outcome. the space inside was compact and small to where the wires were
                all bundled up this was a design flaw but i couldnt figure another way
                to keep it small and compact with good wire management.
